When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I would like to pull changes manually when needed. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks - exists only on Github. its makes a copy of repository on to our account. Any changes made to fork repository will not effect original repository

	Clones - copying a repository from github to local repository. Just makes a copy of complete repository

	Branch - Used when a new feature / bug is to fixed. It works on a repository which is different than master. diverts from master
