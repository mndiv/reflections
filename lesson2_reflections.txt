What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in the project root, which contains all of the necessary metadata for the repo.
	Makes it possible to start recording revisions of the project.

	Files are added to staging area from working directory but are not comitted to the repository.
